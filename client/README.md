CS 4ZP6 - McMaster University Capstone Project

This project requires the following things to be installed:

    CMake     http://www.cmake.org/
    SDL       http://www.libsdl.org/

CMake is a type of makefile that can generate platform-specific makefile, such as a Visual Studio project, an XCode
project, a GNU Makefile, or other platforms.

To build the project, make a directory called 'build' in the working directory of the source tree, enter it, and
in the terminal execute

    cmake ..

Depending on the CMake target, you can either type 'make' to build the project using the system make with gcc, or
you can create a Visual Studio or XCode project.
